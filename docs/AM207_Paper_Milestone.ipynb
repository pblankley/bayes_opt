    "We plan to focus on the underlying Gaussian Processes used in the optimization procedure, since theyâ€™re more general than the specific optimization application. We will also emphasize the difference between Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD) and ARD Matern (a less-smooth and more realistic version of ARD). Then, we would like to apply the hyperparameter optimization to a simple, well understood neural network problem like MNIST.  Finally, we want all the code we write for this project to be easy to use and extensible for use in both our and other student's future projects.\n"
